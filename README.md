# Web3Auth

Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord, etc) logins, different wallets, and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application, be it Gaming, DeFi, or NFT.

With Web3Auth applications and wallets, find:
- Simplified onboarding leading to higher conversion rates by as much as 64%
- Key recoverability and availability via enhanced non-custodial 2FA resulting in an 80% reduction of support tickets
- Robust infrastructure that currently already supports 15M users, enterprise-grade MPC, and uptime guarantees
